# ladderpathway-game
The project is creating a program that, with the help of a dictionary, determines the shortest word ladder between two specified words. A word ladder is a list of words where each word is a different dictionary word and differs from the preceding word by one letter. The application utilizes linked lists to investigate ladder pathways, reads the dictionary, and maintains word data. Offering an entertaining and informative wordplay and programming experience, it engages the user by asking them to enter two words. An algorithm is then used to determine the shortest word ladder that connects the two words.
